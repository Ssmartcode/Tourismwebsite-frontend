## Website Presentation

The purpose of this web app is to allow tourism agencies to create their own offers and share them to other users. Any organizer has access to 
a dashboard where he can create, update and delete offers. Also he can manage messages recieved from users that navigates the website. 
To send a message, and add offers to favorites you need to create an accout that has the role of a user. The user can choose the role when creating an accout!
